# azure-to-drawio

Automatically discover Azure resources via [Azure Resource Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/resource-graph/) and generate fully-editable [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net) architecture diagrams — complete with official Azure icons, relationship edges, and network topology containers.

## How It Works

                                                                                                          policy_summary.md
                                                                                                          policy_by_resource.md
                                                                                                          policy_by_policy.md
                                                                                                          rbac_summary.md
                                                                                         icons_used.json
```

The tool runs a seven-stage pipeline. Each stage reads the previous stage's output from the configured `outputDir`, so stages can be re-run independently:

1. **Seed** — Queries Azure Resource Graph (ARG) for all resources in the configured seed scope: resource groups, exact tag matches, and/or tag-key presence. Writes `seed.json`.
2. **Expand** — Reads `seed.json`, recursively extracts ARM ID references from resource properties, and fetches any resources not yet collected. Iterates up to 50 rounds until no new IDs are found. Writes `inventory.json` (the full resource set) and `unresolved.json` (IDs referenced but not found in Azure).
3. **RBAC** *(optional, `includeRbac: true`)* — Reads `inventory.json`, queries `authorizationresources` for role assignments scoped to discovered resources, and writes `rbac.json`.
4. **Policy** *(optional, `includePolicy: true`)* — Reads `inventory.json`, queries Azure Policy state for the discovered resource IDs, and writes `policy.json`.
5. **Graph** — Reads `inventory.json`, `unresolved.json`, and optionally `rbac.json`. Builds a normalized graph model: separates parent and child resources, merges children (VM extensions, SQL firewall rules, etc.) into parent node attributes, extracts typed edges from resource properties, and adds placeholder nodes for unresolved external references. Writes `graph.json`.
6. **Draw.io** — Reads `graph.json` and the icon map from `assets/azure_icon_map.json`. Computes the supported deterministic layout (`SUB>REGION>RG>NET`), generates draw.io XML with positioned nodes, styled icons, edges, UDR callout boxes, and attribute info boxes. Writes `diagram.drawio` and `icons_used.json`. If the `drawio` CLI is on `PATH`, also exports `diagram.svg` and `diagram.png`.
7. **Docs** — Reads `graph.json`, `unresolved.json`, and any available `inventory.json`, `policy.json`, and `rbac.json` artifacts. Generates Markdown reports for inventory, relationships, routing, migration readiness, policy compliance, and RBAC access review: `catalog.md`, `edges.md`, `routing.md`, `migration.md`, `policy_summary.md`, `policy_by_resource.md`, `policy_by_policy.md`, and `rbac_summary.md`.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** — no third-party packages required (uses only the standard library)
- **Azure CLI** (`az`) — authenticated with access to your target subscriptions. The tool calls `az graph query` under the hood.
- **draw.io Desktop CLI** *(optional)* — for automatic SVG/PNG export. Install [drawio-desktop](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases) and ensure the `drawio` binary is on your `PATH`.

---

## Usage

### Synopsis

```
python3 -m tools.azdisc [-v] <command> <config.json>
```

### Global Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Enable debug-level logging (outputs to stderr). Without this flag, only INFO and above are shown. |

### Commands

#### `run` — Run the full pipeline

Executes all pipeline stages in order: seed, expand, rbac, policy, graph, drawio, docs. When `applicationSplit.enabled` is `true`, `run` also generates per-application outputs after the root diagram and docs are written. When `migrationPlan.enabled` is `true`, `run` generates migration planning packs after any split outputs are available.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc run app/myapp/config.json
```

This is the most common way to use the tool. A single command produces the complete diagram and all documentation from scratch.

#### `wizard` — Interactively create config, instructions, and outputs

Starts an interactive workflow that asks about scope, intent, governance, application slicing, migration planning, and execution preferences. The wizard writes a config file, writes a Markdown instruction pack next to it, and can optionally execute the selected workflow immediately.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc wizard app/myapp/config.json
```

Use this when you want the tool to guide you from initial scope definition through discovery, diagrams, split reporting, migration planning, and Copilot-ready prompts.

**Produces:** the chosen `config.json`, `<config>_wizard_instructions.md`, and optionally the selected discovery/report outputs if you choose to execute immediately.

#### `rbac` — Collect RBAC assignments for discovered resources

Reads `inventory.json`, queries Azure Resource Graph authorization resources, filters role assignments to the discovered scope, and writes `rbac.json`.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc rbac app/myapp/config.json
```

**Requires:** `inventory.json` in the output directory, Azure CLI authenticated.
**Produces:** `rbac.json`

#### `policy` — Collect Azure Policy state for discovered resources

Reads `inventory.json`, queries Azure Policy state for the discovered resource IDs, and writes `policy.json`. This is the canonical latest-state policy artifact for the discovered scope.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc policy app/myapp/config.json
```

Only policy state records whose `resourceId` matches the discovered inventory are kept in the artifact. The saved rows are reduced to the latest state per resource/policy identity.

Policy output formats now available from that artifact:
- `policy.json`: raw latest-state rows for machine processing
- `policy_summary.md`: executive summary focused on non-compliance
- `policy_by_resource.md`: human-readable latest policy states grouped by resource
- `policy_by_policy.md`: human-readable latest policy states grouped by policy
- `policy.csv`: flat tabular export for spreadsheet filtering
- `policy.yaml`: structured export grouped as `byResource` and `byPolicy`

**Requires:** `inventory.json` in the output directory, Azure CLI authenticated.
**Produces:** `policy.json`

#### `policy-csv` — Export flat policy compliance data

Reads `policy.json` and writes `policy.csv` so policy compliance can be filtered in spreadsheet tools or imported into other tabular workflows.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc policy-csv app/myapp/config.json
```

**Requires:** `policy.json` in the output directory.
**Produces:** `policy.csv`

#### `policy-yaml` — Export grouped policy compliance data

Reads `policy.json` and writes `policy.yaml`, grouped in both directions: `byResource` and `byPolicy`. This is intended for structured review in editors without requiring custom scripts.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc policy-yaml app/myapp/config.json
```

**Requires:** `policy.json` in the output directory.
**Produces:** `policy.yaml`

#### `telemetry` — Enrich the graph with runtime evidence

Reads the current discovery artifacts and queries supported telemetry sources such as Application Insights dependencies, Activity Log access patterns, and Flow Log network evidence. The command updates `graph.json` with `telemetryEdges` and lets later docs and migration outputs distinguish configuration-derived vs runtime-derived relationships.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc telemetry app/myapp/config.json
```

Use this when you want better runtime dependency evidence without re-running seed or expand.

**Requires:** `graph.json` in the output directory, Azure CLI authenticated, and `enableTelemetry: true` or a config suitable for telemetry queries.
**Produces:** updated `graph.json`

#### `seed` — Seed resources from the configured discovery scope

Queries Azure Resource Graph for the configured seed scope and writes `seed.json` to the output directory.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc seed app/myapp/config.json
```

The tool supports four seed patterns. You must configure at least one of them:

- `seedResourceGroups`: start from one or more specific resource groups
- `seedTags`: start from exact tag/value matches such as `Application=SAP`
- `seedTagKeys`: start from resources that merely have a tag key such as `Application`, regardless of value
- `seedEntireSubscriptions`: start from all resources in the listed `subscriptions`

ARG results are automatically paged and batched across all configured subscriptions.

For resource-group seeding, the underlying Kusto query is:

```kusto
resources
| where resourceGroup in~ ('rg-app-dev', 'rg-app-prod')
| project id, name, type, location, subscriptionId, resourceGroup, tags, sku, kind, systemData, properties
```

For exact tag-based seeding, the query matches the configured tag/value pair exactly, case-insensitively:

```json
{
  "app": "checkout",
  "subscriptions": ["<sub1>", "<sub2>"],
  "outputDir": "app/checkout/out",
  "seedTags": {
    "Application": "checkout"
  }
}
```

Use `seedTags` when you already know the application or workload value you want to scope discovery around. Multiple configured pairs are treated as additional seed criteria.

For tag-key presence seeding, the query only checks that the key exists:

```json
{
  "app": "untagged-review",
  "subscriptions": ["<sub1>"],
  "outputDir": "app/review/out",
  "seedTagKeys": ["Application"]
}
```

Use `seedTagKeys` when you want to discover all tagged workloads first and decide later which tag values matter. This pairs well with `split-preview` and `applicationSplit.values: ["*"]`.

For broad environment baselines, seed all resources in the listed subscriptions:

```json
{
  "app": "landing-zone-baseline",
  "subscriptions": ["<hub-sub>", "<app-sub>", "<data-sub>"],
  "outputDir": "app/landing-zone/out",
  "seedEntireSubscriptions": true
}
```

Use `seedEntireSubscriptions` for tenant or landing-zone style baselines when RG or tag scoping would miss important shared services.

Important distinction:
- seed scope controls what enters `seed.json` before expansion
- `applicationSplit` is a post-discovery reporting and rendering feature that slices the already discovered inventory into per-application outputs

A common tag-driven workflow is:

1. Seed by `seedTagKeys` or a shared resource group.
2. Run `expand` or `run` to build the full inventory.
3. Run `split-preview` to inspect common tag values such as `Application`, `App`, `Workload`, or `Service`.
4. Enable `applicationSplit` and run `split` to generate per-application diagrams and docs.

**Requires:** Azure CLI authenticated (`az login`).
**Produces:** `seed.json`

#### `expand` — Transitively expand resources

Reads `seed.json` and recursively discovers related resources by scanning all ARM ID references embedded in resource properties. Resources referenced but not yet collected are fetched from ARG in batches of 200 IDs. This loop repeats (up to 50 iterations) until convergence — i.e., no new IDs are found.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc expand app/myapp/config.json
```

This stage is what makes the tool discover resources across resource group boundaries. For example, if a NIC in `rg-app-prod` references a subnet in `rg-network-shared`, the expand stage will automatically fetch that subnet even though it was not in the seed list.

IDs that match non-resource patterns (marketplace image references, location metadata, role/policy definitions) are automatically filtered out.

**Requires:** `seed.json` in the output directory, Azure CLI authenticated.
**Produces:** `inventory.json`, `unresolved.json`, `expand_reasons.json`, `expand_reasons.md`

#### `related-candidates` — Find possible related resources by name

Runs the first step of the deep-discovery workflow and writes candidate artifacts under the configured deep-discovery directory.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc related-candidates app/myapp/config.json
```

**Requires:** base `inventory.json`, `deepDiscovery.enabled: true`, Azure CLI authenticated.
**Produces:** the configured candidate and promoted related-resource files.

#### `review-related` — Interactively curate related candidates

Loads the raw candidate and promoted deep-discovery artifacts in a plain terminal workflow so you can filter, inspect nested JSON on demand, and keep or drop items before generating the extended pack.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc review-related app/myapp/config.json
```

**Requires:** base `inventory.json`, deep-discovery candidate and promoted files.
**Produces:** updated promoted file plus `related_review.md`

#### `related-extend` — Generate an extended pack from curated matches

Runs the second step of the deep-discovery workflow by merging the curated promoted resources into a separate extended output directory and reusing the normal report and diagram pipeline there.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc related-extend app/myapp/config.json
```

**Requires:** base `inventory.json`, curated promoted related-resource file.
**Produces:** the configured extended inventory plus the derived graph, diagram, and report artifacts.

#### `graph` — Build graph model

Reads `inventory.json` and builds a normalized graph of nodes and edges.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc graph app/myapp/config.json
```

This stage:
- Separates child resources (e.g., `microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/extensions`) from parent resources and merges them as attributes on the parent node
- Extracts typed edges from each resource's `properties` (see [Relationship Edges](#relationship-edges))
- Collects display attributes for each node (VM size, OS image, SQL SKU, etc.)
- Adds placeholder nodes (marked `isExternal: true`) for any IDs in `unresolved.json`
- If `rbac.json` exists, adds `rbac_assignment` edges

**Requires:** `inventory.json` in the output directory.
**Produces:** `graph.json`

#### `drawio` — Generate draw.io diagram

Reads `graph.json` and produces the draw.io XML diagram.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc drawio app/myapp/config.json
```

The layout algorithm is determined by the `layout` field in your config file (see [Layout Modes](#layout-modes)). If the `drawio` CLI is available on `PATH`, SVG and PNG exports are produced automatically.

**Requires:** `graph.json` in the output directory.
**Produces:** `diagram.drawio`, `icons_used.json`, and optionally `diagram.svg`, `diagram.png`

#### `render-all` — Generate all layout × mode variants

Reads the existing `graph.json` from your output directory and generates diagrams for every combination of layout and diagram mode. Each variant is written to a `variants/<layout>_<mode>/` subfolder alongside your primary output.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc render-all app/myapp/config.json
```

This produces 2 variants (1 layout × 2 modes) so you can compare how your architecture looks in each combination without modifying your primary config. Your original output files remain untouched.

**Requires:** `graph.json` in the output directory (run `graph` or `run` first).
**Produces:** `variants/` directory with subfolders for each combination.

#### `split-preview` — Inspect common tags and candidate application values

Reads `inventory.json` if present, otherwise `seed.json`, and summarizes common tag keys and candidate application values for the configured split keys.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc split-preview app/myapp/config.json
```

Use this after `seed` or `expand` when multiple apps share one resource group and you want to decide how to split diagrams by tags such as `Application`, `App`, `Workload`, or `Service`.

**Requires:** `seed.json` or `inventory.json` in the output directory.
**Produces:** console preview only

#### `split` — Generate per-application diagrams and reports

Reads the root `inventory.json` and `graph.json`, projects one slice per configured application value, and writes separate inventory, graph, diagram, docs, and report files under `applications/<slug>/`.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc split app/myapp/config.json
```

This is the post-discovery rendering path for common tags. Set `applicationSplit.tagKeys` to the tag names you care about and set `applicationSplit.values` to `["*"]` to auto-discover values from the extracted inventory.

**Requires:** `applicationSplit.enabled: true`, plus `inventory.json` and `graph.json` in the output directory.
**Produces:** `applications/<slug>/...` plus `applications.md`

#### `migration-plan` — Generate migration planning packs

Reads the existing discovery artifacts and writes a migration planning pack under `migration-plan/`, plus per-application packs under `migration-plan/applications/<slug>/` when split outputs exist and the configured scope includes them.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc migration-plan app/myapp/config.json
```

Use this when you need deterministic migration templates, stakeholder questions, decision logs, wave planning, and Copilot prompts without re-running Azure discovery. The generated questionnaire and decision trees now expand adaptively when discovery finds signals such as private endpoints, public exposure, policy non-compliance, shared-service coupling, unresolved references, or missing telemetry evidence.

**Requires:** `graph.json` in the output directory. Root and split packs also consume `inventory.json`, `unresolved.json`, `policy.json`, and `rbac.json` when present.
**Produces:** `migration-plan/migration-plan.md`, `migration-plan/migration-questionnaire.md`, `migration-plan/migration-decisions.md`, `migration-plan/decision-trees.md`, `migration-plan/wave-plan.md`, `migration-plan/stakeholder-pack.md`, `migration-plan/technical-gaps.md`, optional `migration-plan/copilot-prompts.md`, and `migration-plan.json`

#### `report-all` — Generate a Markdown report of all diagram variants

Reads the existing `graph.json` from your output directory and generates all supported combinations of layout, diagram mode, and spacing preset (1 × 2 × 2). Each variant is written to a `variants/<layout>_<mode>_<spacing>/` subfolder, and a single `variants/report.md` is produced that links to every variant — embedding PNG previews where the `drawio` CLI is available.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc report-all app/myapp/config.json
```

**Requires:** `graph.json` in the output directory (run `graph` or `run` first).
**Produces:**
- `variants/<layout>_<mode>_<spacing>/` — one subfolder per combination, each containing `diagram.drawio`, `icons_used.json`, `catalog.md`, `edges.md`, `routing.md`, `migration.md`, and optionally `diagram.svg` / `diagram.png`
- `variants/report.md` — a single Markdown document with a section per variant, PNG embed (if available), and a link to the `.drawio` file

#### `test-all` — Render all fixtures × layouts × modes

Exercises every combination against the bundled test fixtures. No Azure credentials needed — useful for CI and development.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc test-all [output_dir]
```

**Produces:** `<output_dir>/<fixture>/<layout>_<mode>/` directories with full diagram + docs output.

#### `docs` — Generate documentation

Reads `graph.json` plus any available supporting artifacts and produces the Markdown reporting set used by architecture, migration, and governance review.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc docs app/myapp/config.json
```

**Requires:** `graph.json` in the output directory.
**Produces:** `catalog.md`, `edges.md`, `routing.md`, `migration.md`, and when `policy.json` / `rbac.json` exist, `policy_summary.md`, `policy_by_resource.md`, `policy_by_policy.md`, and `rbac_summary.md`. Separate export commands can also generate `policy.csv` and `policy.yaml`.

Policy reporting guidance:
- Use `policy_summary.md` for a quick governance snapshot.
- Use `policy_by_resource.md` when a human wants to review each resource and see which policies are compliant or non-compliant.
- Use `policy_by_policy.md` when a human wants to review each policy and see which resources are compliant or non-compliant.
- Use `policy.csv` when filtering in spreadsheet tools is easiest.
- Use `policy.yaml` when you want a structured file grouped in both directions without writing scripts.

#### `inventory-csv` — Export tabular inventory

Reads `inventory.json` and writes a flat CSV export for spreadsheet-style review.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc inventory-csv app/myapp/config.json
```

**Requires:** `inventory.json` in the output directory.
**Produces:** `inventory.csv`

#### `inventory-yaml` — Export grouped inventory

Reads `inventory.json` and writes a grouped YAML export controlled by `inventoryGroupBy`.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc inventory-yaml app/myapp/config.json
```

**Requires:** `inventory.json` in the output directory.
**Produces:** `inventory.yaml`

#### `master-report` — Generate a consolidated architecture report

Reads the current output folder and writes a single `master_report.md` that links inventory, topology, routing, migration, governance, and migration-planning artifacts. When policy and RBAC artifacts are present, it also includes snapshot counts and a per-resource access summary table.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc master-report app/myapp/config.json
```

**Requires:** the relevant artifacts you want linked or summarized, typically `graph.json` and any optional `policy.json`, `rbac.json`, and `migration-plan/` outputs.
**Produces:** `master_report.md`

### Typical Workflows

**Start with the guided wizard:**

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc wizard app/myapp/config.json
```

The wizard writes a config, writes a matching instruction pack, and can optionally execute the selected workflow immediately. It supports resource-group scoping, tag-based scoping, and full listed-subscription seeding.

**Full run from scratch:**

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc run app/myapp/config.json
```

**Re-generate diagram after changing layout mode (no Azure re-query):**

```bash
# Edit config.json to change the diagram mode or spacing
python3 -m tools.azdisc drawio app/myapp/config.json
```

**Re-build graph and diagram after manually editing inventory.json:**

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc graph app/myapp/config.json
python3 -m tools.azdisc drawio app/myapp/config.json
```

**Generate only documentation, skip diagram:**

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc seed app/myapp/config.json
python3 -m tools.azdisc expand app/myapp/config.json
python3 -m tools.azdisc graph app/myapp/config.json
python3 -m tools.azdisc docs app/myapp/config.json
```

**Collect compliance after discovery without re-running seed/expand:**

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc expand app/myapp/config.json
python3 -m tools.azdisc policy app/myapp/config.json
```

**Render per-application diagrams from common tags after extraction:**

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc run app/myapp/config.json
python3 -m tools.azdisc split-preview app/myapp/config.json
# set applicationSplit.enabled=true and applicationSplit.values=["*"] in config.json
python3 -m tools.azdisc split app/myapp/config.json
```

This workflow is useful when several applications live in the same resource group and you want separate diagrams based on tags discovered in the extracted data.

**Generate migration planning templates after discovery:**

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc run app/myapp/config.json
python3 -m tools.azdisc migration-plan app/myapp/config.json
```

If `migrationPlan.enabled` is `true`, `run` writes the same planning pack automatically after root and split artifacts are ready. The questionnaire and decision-tree outputs expand based on discovered signals such as public exposure, private connectivity, shared dependencies, and policy non-compliance.

**Generate the consolidated master report after docs and planning artifacts exist:**

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc run app/myapp/config.json
python3 -m tools.azdisc master-report app/myapp/config.json
```

**Generate a Markdown report of all 12 diagram variants (layout × mode × spacing):**

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc run app/myapp/config.json
python3 -m tools.azdisc report-all app/myapp/config.json
# produces variants/report.md with PNG previews and .drawio links for every combination
```

**Verbose mode for debugging:**

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc -v run app/myapp/config.json
```

| `seedTagKeys` | `string[]` | No | `[]` | list of non-empty strings | Seed resources by tag-key presence, regardless of value. |
| `seedEntireSubscriptions` | `bool` | No | `false` | `true`, `false` | Seeds all resources in the listed `subscriptions`. Use this for broad environment baselines when you want more than RG- or tag-scoped discovery. |
| `outputDir` | `string` | Yes | — | — | Directory where all generated files are written. Created automatically if needed. |
| `includeRbac` | `bool` | No | `false` | `true`, `false` | When `true`, runs the RBAC stage and writes `rbac.json`, adding `rbac_assignment` edges to the graph. |
| `includePolicy` | `bool` | No | `false` | `true`, `false` | When `true`, runs the Azure Policy stage and writes `policy.json` with policy state records for discovered resources. |
| `enableTelemetry` | `bool` | No | `false` | `true`, `false` | When `true`, the `run` command executes telemetry enrichment after graph generation. |
| `telemetryLookbackDays` | `int` | No | `7` | positive integers | Lookback window used by telemetry queries. |
| `layout` | `string` | No | `"SUB>REGION>RG>NET"` | `"SUB>REGION>RG>NET"` | The only supported layout. Groups nodes as subscription → region → resource group, with separate Networking and Resources sections inside each RG. |
| `diagramMode` | `string` | No | `"MSFT"` | `"MSFT"`, `"L2R"` | Rendering mode for the supported layout. See [Diagram Modes](#diagram-modes). |
| `spacing` | `string` | No | `"compact"` | `"compact"`, `"spacious"` | Whitespace preset for diagram layout. |
| `expandScope` | `string` | No | `"related"` | `"related"`, `"all"` | Discovery breadth during `expand`. `related` follows known relationship references; `all` follows every ARM ID found in resource properties. |
| `inventoryGroupBy` | `string` | No | `"type"` | `"type"`, `"rg"` | Controls the top-level grouping in `inventory.yaml`. |
| `networkDetail` | `string` | No | `"full"` | `"compact"`, `"full"` | Network rendering detail level. `compact` hides plumbing nodes such as NICs and subnets and replaces them with per-resource network summary annotations where supported. |
| `edgeLabels` | `bool` | No | `false` | `true`, `false` | When `true`, writes textual relationship labels on diagram edges. |
| `subnetColors` | `bool` | No | `false` | `true`, `false` | Reserved for subnet/VNet-style layouts. The current supported render surface does not use this flag. |
| `groupByTag` | `string[]` | No | `[]` | list of non-empty strings | Splits the Resources section into additional tag-based subsections. `["any"]` checks common app/workload tag names and groups untagged resources under `Untagged`. |
| `layoutMagic` | `bool` | No | `false` | `true`, `false` | Enables degree-aware ordering and adaptive column counts to produce a different, often denser layout. |
| `deepDiscovery` | `object` | No | disabled | see below | Optional two-step deep-discovery workflow for finding name-matched resources outside the base application inventory and generating an extended pack in a dedicated directory. |
| `applicationSplit` | `object` | No | disabled | see below | Optional post-discovery slicing of inventory, graph, diagram, and reports into per-application outputs based on tags. |
| `migrationPlan` | `object` | No | disabled | see below | Optional migration planning pack generation from existing discovery artifacts. |

At least one of `seedResourceGroups`, `seedTags`, `seedTagKeys`, or `seedEntireSubscriptions` must be provided.

### Choosing A Seed Strategy

Use these rules of thumb:

- Choose `seedResourceGroups` when the environment is already cleanly separated by resource group.
- Choose `seedTags` when you know the exact application or workload value to target, such as `Application=SAP`.
- Choose `seedTagKeys` when you want to discover tagged workloads first and decide later which values to split by.
- Choose `seedEntireSubscriptions` when you are building a broad baseline of a shared platform, landing zone, or poorly tagged estate.

You can combine `seedResourceGroups`, `seedTags`, and `seedTagKeys`. The seed stage treats them as additive scope criteria. `seedEntireSubscriptions` is the broadest mode and is typically used on its own.

## Deep Discovery

Use deep discovery when the normal seeded discovery is complete but you still need to do due diligence for possible related resources that may sit in a different resource group or subscription and may not be reachable through ARM-ID expansion. The intended use case is catching name-based clues such as `SAP` or `bpc` in resources like Logic Apps or Data Collection Rules.

This workflow is intentionally separate from the default `run` pipeline:
- Base discovery stays deterministic and scope-driven.
- Deep discovery is opt-in and heuristic.
- Extended outputs are written to a dedicated directory so the base pack is left unchanged.

### How It Works

Deep discovery has two commands:

1. `related-candidates`
   Searches Azure Resource Graph across the configured `subscriptions` for resources whose `name` contains one or more configured `deepDiscovery.searchStrings`.

2. `review-related`
   Opens the candidate set in a terminal review loop so you can inspect nested JSON, filter noise, and update the promoted file without manually editing raw JSON.

3. `related-extend`
   Reads the curated promoted list, merges those resources into an extended application inventory, and generates diagrams and reports in a separate extended directory.

### Config

```json
{
  "deepDiscovery": {
    "enabled": true,
    "searchStrings": ["SAP", "bpc"],
    "candidateFile": "related_candidates.json",
    "promotedFile": "related_promoted.json",
    "outputDirName": "deep-discovery",
    "extendedOutputDirName": "extended"
  }
}
```

Field meanings:
- `enabled`: turns the feature on for the related-resource commands.
- `searchStrings`: case-insensitive substrings matched against Azure resource `name`.
- `candidateFile`: raw candidate output written by `related-candidates`.
- `promotedFile`: editable file used to curate which candidates should enter the extended pack.
- `outputDirName`: subdirectory under the base `outputDir` used for deep-discovery artifacts.
- `extendedOutputDirName`: subdirectory under the deep-discovery directory where the extended pack is generated.

### Workflow

1. Run the normal base discovery pipeline.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc run app/myapp/config.json
```

2. Find possible related resources by name.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc related-candidates app/myapp/config.json
```

This writes two files under `outputDir/deep-discovery/` by default:
- `related_candidates.json`: the raw candidate set discovered by name matching, now including additive explainability metadata.
- `related_promoted.json`: initialized with the same content so the user can remove noise.
- `related_review.md`: a Markdown review/report artifact describing why each candidate was surfaced and whether it is currently kept or dropped.

3. Review and curate the promoted file.

Use `review-related` to keep or drop candidates interactively, or edit `related_promoted.json` directly if you prefer. The review flow also refreshes `related_review.md` with the current kept/dropped state and candidate explanations.

4. Generate the extended pack.

```bash
python3 -m tools.azdisc related-extend app/myapp/config.json
```

This writes a separate pack under `outputDir/deep-discovery/extended/` by default, including:
- merged `inventory.json`
- `graph.json`
- `diagram.drawio`
- Markdown reports
- optional RBAC, policy, and telemetry artifacts when enabled

### Behavior Notes

- Matching is currently case-insensitive substring matching on `resources.name` only.
- Candidates already present in the base `inventory.json` are excluded.
- `related-candidates` initializes the promoted file from the raw candidate set each time it runs.
- `related-extend` uses only the curated promoted file, not the full candidate file.
- The base output directory is not modified by the extended generation step.

### `applicationSplit`

Use `applicationSplit` when multiple applications share the same resource group and you want separate outputs after discovery.

```json
{
  "applicationSplit": {
    "enabled": true,
    "tagKeys": ["Application", "App", "Workload", "Service"],
    "values": ["*"],
    "includeSharedDependencies": true,
    "outputLayout": "subdirs"
  },
  "migrationPlan": {
    "enabled": true,
    "audience": "mixed",
    "applicationScope": "both",
    "includeCopilotPrompts": true
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enables the split stage. |
| `mode` | `string` | `"tag-value"` | Current split mode. Only `tag-value` is supported. |
| `tagKeys` | `string[]` | `["Application", "App", "Workload", "Service"]` | Tag keys checked in order when assigning resources to an application slice. |
| `values` | `string[]` | `["*"]` | Explicit application values to render, or `["*"]` to auto-discover values from the extracted data. |
| `includeSharedDependencies` | `bool` | `true` | Includes shared, untagged, or contextual dependencies needed to keep each application slice coherent. |
| `outputLayout` | `string` | `"subdirs"` | Output layout for split artifacts. Only `subdirs` is supported. |

With `values: ["*"]`, you can:

1. Run `seed` or `run`.
2. Run `split-preview` to inspect common tags and candidate values.
3. Run `split` to generate `applications/<slug>/diagram.drawio`, docs, and inventory files for each discovered value.

Recommended tag-based discovery patterns:

- If you already know the target app value, use `seedTags` such as `{"Application": "SAP"}` and optionally still enable `applicationSplit` for separate reporting.
- If several apps share one resource group, seed that RG or use `seedTagKeys`, then use `split-preview` and `applicationSplit` to separate them after discovery.
- If tags are inconsistent, use `seedEntireSubscriptions` or broader RG seeding first, then narrow the reporting view with `applicationSplit.tagKeys`.

### `migrationPlan`

Use `migrationPlan` to generate migration planning packs from the artifacts already written to `outputDir`. The dedicated `migration-plan` command never needs to query Azure again if the required artifacts already exist.

```json
{
  "migrationPlan": {
    "enabled": true,
    "outputDir": "migration-plan",
    "audience": "mixed",
    "applicationScope": "both",
    "includeCopilotPrompts": true
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | When `true`, `run` also generates migration planning packs after discovery, docs, and any configured split outputs complete. |
| `outputDir` | `string` | `"migration-plan"` under `outputDir` | Output folder for generated planning artifacts. Relative paths are resolved under the main `outputDir`. |
| `audience` | `string` | `"mixed"` | Planning pack tone and emphasis. Valid values: `mixed`, `technical`, `executive`. |
| `applicationScope` | `string` | `"both"` | Generates root packs, split packs, or both. Valid values: `root`, `split`, `both`. |
| `includeCopilotPrompts` | `bool` | `true` | Writes `copilot-prompts.md` with artifact-aware prompt templates for Copilot-assisted planning and review. |

The generated planning pack includes:
- `migration-plan.md`
- `migration-questionnaire.md`
- `migration-decisions.md`
- `decision-trees.md`
- `wave-plan.md`
- `stakeholder-pack.md`
- `technical-gaps.md`
- optional `copilot-prompts.md`
- `migration-plan.json`

`migration-plan.json` contains the pack summary used to drive the adaptive content, including counts and booleans for signals such as public exposure, private endpoints, policy evidence, non-compliant policy findings, shared dependencies, telemetry evidence, and unresolved references.

## Layout Modes

### `SUB>REGION>RG>NET`

Organizes resources in a full environment hierarchy with subscriptions as the top-level container, designed for multi-subscription Azure Landing Zone documentation:

```
┌── Subscription ...00000001 ────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ┌── Region: westeurope ────────────────────────────────────┐  │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Resources inside each resource group are split into two sections:

- **Networking** — VNets, subnets, NSGs, route tables, firewalls, bastion hosts, application gateways, load balancers, public IPs, private endpoints, NICs, NAT gateways, firewall policies, VPN/local network gateways, and connections. Each specific network resource type gets its own sub-header.
- **Resources** — Everything else, grouped by category (Compute, Databases, Storage, Monitoring, etc.) with sub-headers.

This layout produces a 3-level container hierarchy (subscription → region → resource group) so cross-subscription relationships like VNet peering and shared Log Analytics workspaces are clearly visible as edges spanning container boundaries.

**Best for:** Azure Landing Zone migration documentation, multi-subscription environment mapping, full-picture architecture reviews with architects and application teams.

**Example config:**

```json
{
  "app": "landing-zone",
  "subscriptions": ["<hub-sub>", "<app-sub>", "<data-sub>"],
  "seedResourceGroups": ["rg-connectivity-prod", "rg-app-prod", "rg-data-prod"],
  "outputDir": "app/landing-zone/out",
  "layout": "SUB>REGION>RG>NET",
  "diagramMode": "MSFT"
}
```

---

## Diagram Modes

The `diagramMode` config field controls the visual rendering style. This is independent of the `layout` field.

### `MSFT`

Microsoft Architecture Center style rendering. Resources are organized inside hierarchical containers with true draw.io parenting:

```
┌── Region: eastus ──────────────────────────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────────┐
│  ┌── RG: rg-prod ───────────────────────────────────┐  │    │ UDR: rt-web         │
│  │  Compute                                          │  │    │ 10.0.0.0/8 → VNet   │
│  │  ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐                        │  │    │ 0.0.0.0/0 → FW      │
│  │  │ vm-web   │ │ vm-app   │                        │  │    └─────────────────────┘
│  │  └──────────┘ └──────────┘                        │  │
│  │  Networking                                       │  │
│  │  ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐          │  │
│  │  │ vnet     │ │ nic-web  │ │ nsg-web  │          │  │
│  │  └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘          │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Key characteristics:

| Feature | MSFT |
|---------|------|
| Grouping | Explicit subscription, region, and RG containers |
| Node parenting | Hierarchical: subscription → region → RG → node |
| Type sections | Labeled headers (Compute, Networking, Storage, etc.) |
| UDR display | Side panels with route details |
| Edge style | Orthogonal without labels by default |

Within each resource group container, resources are organized by type category (Compute, Networking, Storage, Databases, etc.) with section headers. Resources are laid out in a 6-column grid within each section.

UDR side panels are placed to the right of the region containers and connected to subnet nodes with `udr_detail` edges. Each panel shows the route table name and up to 8 routes (with a truncation indicator for larger tables).

**Best for:** Architecture documentation, presentations, Microsoft Architecture Center-style diagrams.

### `L2R`

Left-to-Right rendering mode. Resources and network items within each resource group are split into two side-by-side sections: compute/storage resources on the left, directly-attached network resources on the right. Network items not directly connected to resources in the seed RGs are omitted from the main canvas and summarised in a context box instead.

```
┌── Subscription ...00000001 ────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ┌── Region: eastus ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │  ┌── RG: rg-prod ───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ │
│  │  │  Resources                  │  Network                           │ │ │
│  │  │  ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐      │  ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐  │ │ │
│  │  │  │ vm-web │ │ vm-app │      │  │  vnet  │ │  nsg   │ │  udr   │  │ │ │
│  │  │  └────────┘ └────────┘      │  └────────┘ └────────┘ └────────┘  │ │ │
│  │  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │ │
│  └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌── Network context (indirect) ─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  hub-vnet (peering) · shared-nsg                                           │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Key differences from `MSFT` mode:

| Feature | MSFT | L2R |
|---------|------|-----|
| Resource / network split | Category sections | Left (resources) / Right (network) columns |
| Subscription grouping | Explicit container | Explicit container |
| Network filtering | All shown | Only directly attached items shown on the main canvas |
| UDR display | Side panels | Context box for indirect items |
| Edge style | Orthogonal | Minimal orthogonal |

Each resource group container shows a "Resources" header on the left and a "Network" header on the right. Only network items with a direct attachment edge from a resource in the seed RGs appear in the diagram; all other network items (hub VNets, shared NSGs, etc.) are listed in a context box below the subscriptions.

**Best for:** Application-centric views where the emphasis is on compute workloads with their immediately-attached network infrastructure, without the noise of unrelated network resources.

---

## Spacing

The `spacing` config field controls whitespace between icons in the diagram. When icon labels overlap or the diagram feels cramped, switching to `"spacious"` adds breathing room without changing icon sizes.

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `"compact"` | Default. Current behavior — tightest layout. |
| `"spacious"` | 1.8x gaps and padding between icons. Labels no longer overlap. |

Only the whitespace between icons is scaled. Icon cell sizes remain unchanged, so icons look the same — they are just further apart.

**Example — enable spacious layout:**

```json
{
  "app": "myapp",
  "subscriptions": ["<sub>"],
  "seedResourceGroups": ["rg-prod"],
  "outputDir": "app/myapp/out",
  "layout": "SUB>REGION>RG>NET",
  "diagramMode": "MSFT",
  "spacing": "spacious"
}
```

The spacing option works with the supported layout mode (`SUB>REGION>RG>NET`) and both supported diagram modes (`MSFT`, `L2R`). In `MSFT` mode, RG containers, region containers, and type section headers all grow proportionally. In `L2R` mode, all container padding and inter-icon gaps scale proportionally.

### Other Rendering Flags

- `networkDetail: "full" | "compact"` controls whether network plumbing is rendered in full or summarized where compact mode is supported.
- `edgeLabels: true` turns edge-kind labels on.
- `groupByTag` adds tag-based subsections within the Resources section.
- `layoutMagic: true` changes ordering and column counts to produce a different packing of nodes.
- `subnetColors` is currently accepted by config but not used by the supported render surface.

**When to use spacious:**
- Diagrams with long resource names (labels overlap their neighbors)
- Presentation or documentation contexts where readability matters more than compactness
- Large architectures where the default grid feels too dense

---

## Output Artifacts

All output files are written to the directory specified by `outputDir` in your config. Below is an exhaustive description of every file produced by the pipeline.

### `seed.json`

**Produced by:** `seed` stage
**Format:** JSON array of Azure resource objects

Contains the raw resources returned by the initial Azure Resource Graph query. Each object has the fields projected by ARG: `id`, `name`, `type`, `location`, `subscriptionId`, `resourceGroup`, `properties`.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/rg-prod/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm-web-01",
    "name": "vm-web-01",
    "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines",
    "location": "eastus",
    "subscriptionId": "...",
    "resourceGroup": "rg-prod",
    "properties": { "hardwareProfile": { "vmSize": "Standard_D4s_v3" }, ... }
  },
  ...
]
```

### `inventory.json`

**Produced by:** `expand` stage
**Format:** JSON array of Azure resource objects (same schema as `seed.json`)

The complete, deduplicated set of all discovered resources — both seeded and transitively expanded. Sorted by normalized resource ID. This file is the primary input for the `graph` stage.

### `unresolved.json`

**Produced by:** `expand` stage
**Format:** JSON array of ARM ID strings

Lists ARM resource IDs that were referenced in resource properties but could not be found via ARG queries. These typically represent resources in other subscriptions you don't have access to, recently deleted resources, or cross-tenant references. Sorted alphabetically.

```json
[
  "/subscriptions/abc/resourcegroups/rg-shared/providers/microsoft.network/virtualnetworks/vnet-hub",
  ...
]
```

In the `graph` stage, these IDs become placeholder nodes marked `isExternal: true` and rendered as red ellipses in the diagram.

### `rbac.json`

**Produced by:** `run` (RBAC sub-stage, only when `includeRbac: true`)
**Format:** JSON array of role assignment resource objects

Contains Azure role assignments (`microsoft.authorization/roleassignments`) whose scope matches any discovered resource or resource group. Each object has `id`, `name`, `type`, and `properties` (which includes `scope`, `roleDefinitionId`, `principalId`, etc.).

### `graph.json`

**Produced by:** `graph` stage
**Format:** JSON object with two top-level keys: `nodes` and `edges`

The normalized graph model consumed by the `drawio` and `docs` stages.

**Node schema:**
```json
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/.../providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/vm-web-01",
  "stableId": "a1b2c3d4e5f67890",
  "name": "vm-web-01",
  "type": "microsoft.compute/virtualmachines",
  "location": "eastus",
  "resourceGroup": "rg-prod",
  "subscriptionId": "...",
  "properties": { ... },
  "isExternal": false,
  "childResources": [
    { "name": "MDE.Linux", "type": "microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/extensions", "properties": { ... } }
  ],
  "attributes": ["SKU: Standard_D4s_v3", "Image: Canonical/UbuntuServer/18.04-LTS", "OS: Linux", "extensions: MDE.Linux"]
}
```

- `stableId` — A deterministic 16-character hex hash of the lowercase resource ID, used as the cell ID in draw.io XML to ensure stable diagrams across re-runs.
- `isExternal` — `true` for unresolved placeholder nodes.
- `childResources` — Child resources merged into this parent (VM extensions, SQL firewall rules, SQL administrators, NSG security rules).
- `attributes` — Human-readable display strings shown in the attribute info box on the diagram.

**Edge schema:**
```json
{
  "source": "/subscriptions/.../virtualmachines/vm-web-01",
  "target": "/subscriptions/.../networkinterfaces/nic-web-01",
  "kind": "vm->nic"
}
```

Edges are sorted by `(source, target, kind)` and deduplicated.

### `diagram.drawio`

**Produced by:** `drawio` stage
**Format:** draw.io XML (`mxfile` format)

The main diagram output. This is a standard draw.io file that can be opened in:
- [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) (online editor)
- [draw.io Desktop](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases) (offline)
- VS Code with the [Draw.io Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) extension

The file contains:
- **Vertex cells** — One per resource, positioned by the layout engine, styled with the Azure icon from `azure_icon_map.json` (or a generic rounded rectangle for unmapped types, or a red ellipse for external references).
- **Edge cells** — Orthogonal connector lines labeled with the edge kind (e.g., `vm->nic`). Route table edges are excluded from direct rendering — they are shown as UDR callout boxes instead.
- **Container cells** *(VNET>SUBNET mode only)* — Non-connectable group cells for VNets and subnets that visually nest their member resources.
- **UDR callout boxes** — For each route table that has defined routes, a callout shape listing each route's `addressPrefix → nextHopType`. Connected to the associated subnet with a "UDR" labeled edge.
- **Attribute info boxes** — Purple rounded rectangles placed to the left of resource icons, showing key properties (VM SKU, OS image, SQL tier, child resource names). Connected to the resource with a dashed edge.

### `diagram.svg`

**Produced by:** `drawio` stage (only if the `drawio` CLI is on `PATH`)
**Format:** SVG image

An SVG vector export of the diagram, suitable for embedding in wikis, docs, or web pages.

### `diagram.png`

**Produced by:** `drawio` stage (only if the `drawio` CLI is on `PATH`)
**Format:** PNG image

A rasterized export of the diagram, suitable for embedding in Markdown, Confluence pages, or slide decks.

### `icons_used.json`

**Produced by:** `drawio` stage
**Format:** JSON object with three keys

Reports which Azure icon styles were used, for auditing and extending icon coverage:

```json
{
  "mapped": {
    "microsoft.compute/virtualmachines": 2,
    "microsoft.network/networkinterfaces": 2,
    ...
  },
  "fallback": [],
  "unknown": ["microsoft.insights/components"]
}
```

- `mapped` — Resource types that matched an entry in `azure_icon_map.json`, with instance counts.
- `fallback` — Types matched via partial suffix matching (last path segment of the type string).
- `unknown` — Types with no icon match at all, rendered with the generic rounded-rectangle style. Use this list to identify which types to add to `azure_icon_map.json`.

### `catalog.md`

**Produced by:** `docs` stage
**Format:** Markdown

A resource catalog table listing every resource type discovered, with columns for count, regions, resource groups, and subscriptions. Titled with the app name from config.

Example output:

```markdown
# Resource Catalog — myapp

| type | count | regions | resource groups | subscriptions |
|------|-------|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| `microsoft.compute/disks` | 3 | eastus | rg-prod | sub-1 |
| `microsoft.compute/virtualmachines` | 2 | eastus | rg-prod | sub-1 |
| ...  | ...   | ...     | ...             | ...           |
```

### `edges.md`

**Produced by:** `docs` stage
**Format:** Markdown

Edge analysis report containing:

1. **Edge Counts by Kind** — Table of each edge type and how many instances were found.
2. **Top 20 Nodes by Degree** — Table of the 20 most-connected resources (by total in-degree + out-degree), showing name, full ARM ID, and degree count.
3. **External Placeholders** — Count of external/unresolved nodes.
4. **Unresolved References** — The first 50 unresolved ARM IDs (from `unresolved.json`).

### `routing.md`

**Produced by:** `docs` stage
**Format:** Markdown

Network routing and security details:

1. **Summary** — Counts of route tables and subnets with UDRs, with a list of affected subnet names.
2. **Route Tables** — For each route table, lists all routes in a table with `name`, `destination`, `nextHopType`, and `nextHopIp`. Routes are sorted deterministically by address prefix, hop type, hop IP, and name.
3. **Subnet UDR Associations** — Maps each subnet to its associated route table.
4. **Network Security Groups** — For each NSG, lists inbound and outbound security rules in a table with `name`, `priority`, `protocol`, `src`, `dst`, and `action`. Rules are sorted by priority.

## Diagram Features

### Relationship Edges

The graph builder extracts 22 typed edge kinds from resource properties:

| Edge Kind | Source Type | Meaning |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `vm->nic` | `virtualmachines` | VM references a network interface in `networkProfile.networkInterfaces` |

### UDR Callout Boxes

Route tables that contain defined routes are rendered with a special callout shape showing each route entry:

```
Routes:
  10.0.0.0/8 → VirtualAppliance(10.1.0.4)
  0.0.0.0/0 → Internet
```

The callout is connected to the associated subnet with a "UDR" labeled edge. The `subnet->routeTable` edge is not drawn separately — it is replaced by this callout visualization.

### Attribute Info Boxes

Resources with notable properties get a purple info box placed to the left of their icon, connected by a dashed edge. The following attributes are extracted:

| Resource Type | Attributes Shown |
|---------------|------------------|
| Virtual Machines | `SKU: Standard_D4s_v3`, `Image: Canonical/UbuntuServer/18.04-LTS`, `OS: Linux` |
| SQL Servers / Databases | `SKU: GP_Gen5`, `Tier: GeneralPurpose` |
| Any resource with children | `extensions: MDE.Linux`, `firewallRules: AllowAzure`, `administrators: admin@contoso.com` |

### Child Resource Merging

Resources whose ARM type has 3+ path segments after the provider (e.g., `microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/extensions`) are treated as child resources. They are not rendered as separate diagram nodes. Instead, they are merged into their parent node's `childResources` list and displayed as attribute annotations.

The following types are always treated as child resources:

- `microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/extensions`
- `microsoft.sql/servers/firewallrules`
- `microsoft.sql/servers/administrators`
- `microsoft.network/networksecuritygroups/securityrules`
- `microsoft.network/virtualnetworks/subnets/providers`

Additionally, any non-`microsoft.network` type with 3+ segments (e.g., `microsoft.foo/bar/baz`) is heuristically classified as a child resource.

**Exception:** `microsoft.network/virtualnetworks/subnets` is intentionally kept as a standalone node, not merged.

### Icon Matching

For each resource, the draw.io style is resolved in this order:

1. **Exact match** — The full lowercase type string is looked up in `assets/azure_icon_map.json`.
2. **Suffix match** — If no exact match, the last path segment of the type is tried (e.g., for `microsoft.foo/bar/loadbalancers`, it tries `loadbalancers`).
3. **Microsoft icon fallback** — If no draw.io `azure2` icon matches, the tool attempts a fuzzy match against SVGs in `assets/microsoft-azure-icons/` (if present). Matched icons are embedded as base64 data URIs.
4. **Generic fallback** — If no icon matches at all, a generic blue rounded rectangle is used.
5. **External** — Unresolved/external nodes use a red ellipse style.

### Transitive Discovery

The expand stage follows ARM ID references recursively (up to 50 iterations) until no new resources are found. ARM IDs are extracted from all string values in resource properties using a regex pattern. The following non-resource patterns are automatically filtered out:

- `microsoft.compute/locations/*` (marketplace/region metadata)
- `microsoft.compute/galleries/*` (image gallery references)
- `microsoft.marketplace/*`
- `microsoft.compute/images/*`
- `microsoft.authorization/roleDefinitions/*`
- `microsoft.authorization/policyDefinitions/*`

## Supported Azure Resource Types (Icons)

The tool discovers and renders any Azure resource type. **248 resource types** have dedicated Azure icons mapped in `assets/azure_icon_map.json`, covering the following categories:

| Category | Types | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Networking | 41 | Virtual Networks, Subnets, NICs, NSGs, Load Balancers, Application Gateways, Firewalls, DNS Zones, ExpressRoute, VPN Gateways, Private Endpoints, Traffic Manager, Front Door, NAT Gateways, Bastion, Private Link, … |
| Compute | 21 | Virtual Machines, VM Scale Sets, Disks, Snapshots, Images, Availability Sets, Host Groups, Galleries, SSH Keys, … |
| Web | 9 | App Services, App Service Plans, Function Apps, Static Web Apps, App Service Environments, … |
| SQL & Databases | 7 | SQL Servers, SQL Databases, Elastic Pools, Managed Instances, … |
| Monitoring | 7 | Application Insights, Log Analytics, Alerts, Autoscale, Action Groups, Dashboards, … |
| Storage | 5 | Storage Accounts, Data Lake, NetApp Files, Storage Movers, … |
| Event Grid | 5 | Topics, Subscriptions, Domains, System Topics, Partner Namespaces |
| Containers | 3 | AKS, Container Registry, Container Instances, … |
| Integration | 3 | Logic Apps, Service Bus, Event Hubs, … |
| Other | 147 | Key Vault, Cosmos DB, Redis Cache, API Management, Cognitive Services, Machine Learning, IoT Hub, DevTest Labs, Managed Identity, and many more |

To add icons for additional resource types, add entries to `assets/azure_icon_map.json`. The key is the lowercase ARM resource type; the value is a draw.io style string referencing an SVG from the built-in `azure2` shape library. Check `icons_used.json` after a run to see which types have `"unknown"` mappings.

### Microsoft Icon ZIP Fallback

For resource types not covered by `azure_icon_map.json`, the tool supports an optional fallback using Microsoft's official Azure icon SVGs. Place the extracted icon files in `assets/microsoft-azure-icons/` (SVG files following Microsoft's naming pattern: `{number}-icon-service-{Service-Name}.svg`).

When this directory exists, the tool:
1. Builds a normalized keyword index from all SVG filenames
2. Attempts fuzzy matching against ARM resource type strings (full resource type, suffix-stripped variants, provider name)
3. Embeds matched SVGs as base64 data URIs in the draw.io cell style
4. Regenerates `assets/azure-fallback.mxlibrary` — a draw.io-importable library of all discovered Microsoft icons

Types resolved via this fallback are reported as `"fallback"` (rather than `"mapped"`) in `icons_used.json`.

## Running Tests

```bash
pip install pytest
python -m pytest tools/azdisc/tests/ -v
```

All tests run entirely offline using fixture data — no Azure credentials or network access required. The test suite covers:

- **ARM ID parsing** — Regex extraction from strings/dicts/lists, normalization, deduplication, non-resource filtering
- **Stable IDs** — Determinism, fixed length (16 hex chars), case insensitivity
- **Edge extraction** — All 22 edge kinds individually (including firewall, bastion, container apps, app insights, app gateway, logic apps), sort order, no duplicates
- **Child resources** — Type detection heuristic, parent ID derivation, attribute collection (VM SKU/image, SQL SKU)
- **Layout engines** — `REGION>RG>TYPE`, `VNET>SUBNET`, `SUB>REGION>RG>NET`, `MSFT` mode, and `L2R` mode: determinism, positive coordinates, no overlapping nodes, correct cell dimensions
- **Spacing presets** — `compact` (default, backward compatible) and `spacious` (1.8x gaps): config validation, bounding box growth, cell sizes unchanged, label gap sufficiency, no overlaps, integration with all layout/diagram mode combinations
- **VNET>SUBNET containers** — VNet/subnet container cells exist, correct parent nesting, expected labels
- **MSFT mode** — Region/RG container hierarchy, type section headers, hierarchical parenting via `parent` attribute, UDR side panels with route details, deterministic layout
- **SUB>REGION>RG>NET layout** — 3-level subscription→region→RG hierarchy, networking/resources section split, cross-subscription edge validation, subscription label helper, network type classification, spacing effects, edge cases (empty inventory, single node, multi-region, missing subscription)
- **Microsoft icon fallback** — Index building from SVG filenames, normalized keyword matching, fuzzy lookup for ARM types, base64 data URI style generation, fallback library regeneration
- **AI chatbot fixture** — Production-grade Container Apps + OpenAI + hub-spoke architecture: graph construction, private endpoint chains, VNet peering, all 3 layout modes, spacious mode, determinism
- **Landing zone fixture** — Multi-subscription hub-spoke: 3 subscriptions, Azure Firewall, Bastion, Container Apps, private endpoints, cross-subscription App Insights→workspace edges
- **Render-all / test-all** — All fixture × layout × mode combinations generate valid XML, variant folders created, primary output preserved
- **Full integration** — Fixture → `build_graph` → `generate_drawio` → validates XML structure, vertex/edge cell counts, geometry, node labels
- **PNG/SVG export** — When the `drawio` CLI is available: valid PNG header, SVG file created. Graceful skip when CLI is absent.

## CI / GitHub Actions

The workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs on every push and pull request to `main`:

1. Sets up Python 3.11 and installs `pytest`
2. Installs the draw.io Desktop CLI (with an `xvfb-run` wrapper for headless export)
3. Runs the full pytest suite
4. Generates integration diagrams for every fixture × layout × diagram mode combination via `test-all` (currently 5 fixtures × 3 layouts × 3 modes = 45 combinations)
5. Uploads the full `out/test-all` tree as the `test-diagrams-all-combinations` artifact
6. On pull requests, posts (or updates) a PR comment with a table of node/edge counts and PNG availability for every combination
